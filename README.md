# Silly-Name-Picker
Random silly name picker. I got the idea from a book, it was originally in python, but since I'm learning typescript, i was like why not make it in typescript? 

# Setting up the program
first install nodejs ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )
Either LTS Version or Current versions would run this

# Step two
One node js is installed, open Command Prompt and type

npm install -g typescript

# Step 3
head to the folder where you have the program located and in command prompt type

tsc program.ts

# Step 4

in the same command prompt, type 

node program.js
